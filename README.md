# Event Trigger

The Event Trigger allows [Moodle Events](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2) to be monitored and a *workflow* to be triggered when that event occurs.<br/>
One of the main use cases of this plugin is to allow Moodle events to trigger actions in external systems.

Each workflow is made up of a series of *steps*. Steps can be things like:
* Using event data to *lookup* user and course information
* *Filtering* data based on a set of conditions
* Performing an *action* like sending an email or Posting data to a HTTP endpoint or external API.

The plugin is designed to be extensible and contributions are welcome to extend the available actions.
